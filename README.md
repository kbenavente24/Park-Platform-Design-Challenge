# Park-Platform-Design-Challenge

# What is the Park Platform Design Challenge?:
Teams were tasked with creating two distinct interface concepts (one for mobile, one for web) for a neighborhood park information-sharing platform. The goal is to address the lack of a centralized park resource by designing user-friendly interfaces that support key tasks like searching for parks, viewing ratings, reporting safety issues, and finding events.

# Our Park Platform App:
Our app is designed to centralize park information and enhance community engagement. It allows users to:

Access details on all neighborhood parks in one place.
Collaborate by sharing insights and updates.
Filter parks based on specific preferences.
View user ratings and reviews to find the best parks.
Report safety or maintenance issues to keep parks safe and well-maintained.

# Importance of the Selected Tasks
A GPS-oriented, filterable search was prioritized to help users quickly find local parks that meet their needs. However, to foster community engagement, we added features such as favorites and issue reporting, ensuring users can track preferred parks and notify others of concerns.

# Incorporating Peer Feedback
In our initial design, the mobile app lacked key features, pushing much of the functionality to the website. This disrupted the flow and usability of the app. Based on feedback, we integrated "issue reporting" and "favorites" into the mobile version, making it more functional and user-friendly. Our peers appreciated the simple, icon-driven design, which helped reduce clutter while maintaining accessibility. This input guided our prototype redesign to improve navigation and overall user experience.

# Enhancing User Experience
To make the app intuitive and inclusive, we focused on:

A minimalist interface with icons to reduce visual clutter.
Accessibility for users of all ages and language backgrounds.
A favorites feature to personalize the experience.
A park details page that includes reviews, hours of operation, and issue reporting.
These improvements ensure that the platform is easy to use, visually appealing, and fosters community involvement in maintaining and enjoying local parks.
